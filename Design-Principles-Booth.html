        <h2>Complexity and Simplicity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A site should only be as complex as it needs to be</li>
            <li>Every site has a mandatory level of complexity</li>
            <li>A user should gain functional experience with a site very fast</li>
            <li>Users with functional site experience should not need to think when using the site</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="div2">
        <h2>Inclusiveness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Always ask what disabilities does this site not support</li>
            <li>Text-to-speech is always a great option</li>
            <li>Having alternate color and text schemes for the visually impaired is important</li>
            <li>Provide haptic/sensory feedback for supported devices</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="div1">
        <h2>Cultural</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider Societal ethics (i.e. individualism vs communitarianism)</li>
            <li>Remember some cultures read left to right</li>
            <li>Research potential metaphors before using them (ex. In some countries a thumbs up is a sign of disrespect, so you should avoid using it as a positive metaphor)</li>
            <li>Avoid using United States standards for sites that may have worldwide reach, like having prices only is USD or putting the US at the top of a country drop-down list</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="div2">
        <h2>Ease of Use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use metaphors for interactions</li>
            <li>Take from nature/natural understanding when designing</li>
            <li>Guide the user to actions they would want to take</li>
            <li>Make sure users don't reactionarily make important decisions</li>
            <li>All actions should have feedback</li>
            <li>The website should use colors, feedback, and standard conventions to create affordance (i.e. the user should know what is interactable)</li>
            <li>Follow Jakob's law - your site should look like other sites</li>
            <li>Have helpful notifications or tips for complicated actions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="div1">
        <h2>Attention/Distraction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Only push notifications that are important</li>
            <li>Understand how exterior distractions may affect your users experience</li>
            <li>Consider people with ADHD and how distractions could affect them</li>
            <li>Find the write times to give people helpful information and tips to avoid distractions</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="div2">
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the users you are designing for</li>
            <li>Anthropomorphism can be used to develop an emotional attatchment or positive reaction</li>
            <li>AI can be useful, but only use AI for decisions if you can understand and back up the conclusion</li>
            <li>Your site should have a consistent mood</li>
            <li>Listen to user feedback and adjust your site as needed</li>
            <li>Never trick the user into performing an action (follow ethical standards!)</li>
        </ul>
